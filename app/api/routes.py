def upload_csv():
    """
    Endpoint to upload and process a CSV file for different tables.
    This function handles the upload of a CSV file and processes its content to insert data into the specified table.
    The table is determined by the 'table_name' parameter provided in the form data.
    The function supports three tables:
    - 'employees': The CSV file must contain 5 columns.
    - 'jobs': The CSV file must contain 2 columns.
    - 'departments': The CSV file must contain 2 columns.
    The function performs the following steps:
    1. Validates the presence and format of the uploaded file.
    2. Reads the CSV file into a pandas DataFrame.
    3. Validates the number of columns based on the specified table.
    4. Processes each row of the DataFrame and adds the corresponding records to the database.
    5. Commits the transaction if all operations are successful.
    6. Rolls back the transaction and returns an error message if any exception occurs.
    Returns:
        Response: A JSON response indicating the status of the operation.
        - 200: If the data is successfully loaded into the specified table.
        - 400: If there is a validation error with the file or table name.
        - 500: If an internal server error occurs during processing.
